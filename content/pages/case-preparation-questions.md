1. Draw a process flow diagram showing the major process steps, inventories and flows for hamburger production in Burger King. Where are the inventories and why?
2. For Burger King, analyze the peak hourly capacity and peak hourly demand for burger patties and sandwich production. Can they produce enough burger sandwiches to meet peak demand?
3. Post-class, self-test exercise: Same capacity calculations for McDonald's.

1. What is your diagnosis of the problems with the CVS pharmacy fulfillment process?
2. What changes would you recommend to improve CVS's existing pharmacy fulfillment process?
3. What general principles would you propose for process design, which are relevant in the CVS case?
4. What considerations seem important in implementing the changes you propose?

*NOTE: This case is over ten years old. Today, much more infotech automation is available than was present at that time. Although you can feel free to make suggestions that are infotech-centric, do not focus solely or even primarily on infotech-centric solutions. That is, first think about how to improve the manual process; then consider how it might be automated.*

1. Construct a process flow diagram of the PATA visit from a patient's perspective. Calculate the capacity and utilization rate at each step in the process.
2. Use capacity analysis tools (build-up diagrams or/and queuing) to decide if and where there is a bottleneck in the clinic. If a bottleneck does indeed exist, how long do patients wait as a result of the bottleneck? (As an approximation, assume that all appointment slots were filled and patients arrived on time.)
3. Evaluate the three Task Force diagnoses - not enough time between appointments, not enough rooms, not enough physicians. Are these diagnoses valid? If so, are they primary contributors to long patient wait times? Why or why not?
4. What factors contribute to variability in PATA process flow and what control, if any, does the clinic have to eliminate it?
5. What changes would you recommend to improve PATA?

1. What are the main causes of the inventory/service crisis described in the case?
2. Build and describe an Excel model to recommend quantitative target inventory levels under HP's current supply chain design for the 6 European options assuming a weekly (periodic review) replenishment and a 98% service level (k=2.054) for the following two scenarios: (i) 5-week sea shipment lead-time; (ii) 3-day air shipment lead-time. Evaluate the total supply-chain inventory levels (safety stock, cycle stock, pipeline stock) that will result from the weekly inventory replenishment targets that you recommend for these options.
3. Assuming a 20% gross margin and average selling price of $660 for each printer, inventory holding costs of 50% per year, sea transportation costs of $1 per printer (lead-time 5 weeks) and air transportation costs of $11 per printer (lead-time is 3 days), compute the total supply chain cost (inventory and transportation) for the two scenarios you analyzed in the previous question.
4. Modify the model you built for the previous question in order to quantify the financial impact of localizing HP's DeskJet Printers in Europe instead of Vancouver.
5. What changes would you recommend for HP's supply chain operation and design?

1. Using the sample data given in Exhibit 10, make a quantitative recommendation for how many units of each style Wally should make during the initial phase of production. Assume that all of the ten styles in the sample problem are made in Hong Kong (minimum order quantity 600 units per style, provided any quantity of a style is ordered), and that Wally's initial production commitment must be at least 10,000 units because of capacity constraints later in the season.

*WARNING: There is no 'right' answer here. The models we have looked at will NOT cover all your bases on this problem. Be quantitative but creative; imagine it's your company on the line.*

1. What operational changes would you recommend to Wally to improve performance?

2. Draw the entire supply chain of each company, and also describe the key steps and information sources of their respective design process.
3. How can a buyer at M&S optimize the production order decision under the current supply chain and lead-times? How do buyers make the same decision for Zara?
4. What are the relative benefits of Inditex and Zara's business models?

1. What are the key factors that influence the design of Amazon's U.S. distribution network?
2. What are the main challenges for Amazon to replicate its U.S. operations in Europe?
3. Suppose the weekly demand for a popular tablet computer follows the normal distribution, N (1500, 200) in UK, N (2000, 250) in Germany, and N (1200, 200) in France. Amazon sources the tablet at $250 per unit, and the sourcing lead time is 2 weeks. Each sourcing order costs Amazon $200 in administrative processing and transportation. The company uses a continuous review (R, Q) policy to manage inventory and targets a 98% service level (k = 2.054). Assume an annual interest rate of 50% to calculate inventory holding cost and 52 weeks in a year.
    1. What are the order quantity Q and reorder level R for each DC? Define cycle stock as Q/2, safety stock as R minus the expected demand during lead time, and average inventory as the sum of cycle stock and safety stock. What is the total amount of average inventory held in all three DCs?
    2. If Amazon uses one single DC to serve the tablet demand in all three countries, what are the resulting Q, R, and average inventory held in the DC? How many units of inventory are saved compared to 1?
4. Consider the following three options of designing Amazon's European distribution network:
    1. Keep the status quo (three decentralized DCs serving each country independently);
    2. Keep the existing DCs but centralize the management of them by possibly allowing a DC in one country to fulfill orders in another;
    3. Combine all DCs into a single DC serving multiple countries.

What are the pros and cons of each of these strategies? What are the benefits and challenges of centralization in Amazon's European distribution network?

4. How does the concept of Producer Responsibility evolve? How can Individual Producer Responsibility be eventually achieved?
